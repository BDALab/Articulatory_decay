# Articulatory decay

Extraction of features quantifying resonance frequency attenuation.

> Conditions for features extraction from a segment:
>
> 1. The fundamental speech frequency is between 75 Hz and 400 Hz. The software used to calculate this frequency is PRAAT.
> 2. The frequency of the second formant is within 3 kHz.
> 3. There is at least one local minimum.
> 4. The modulus of the first formant is higher than that of the third.
> 5. The lowest modulus of the first three formants is higher than the highest modulus of the remaining formants.
